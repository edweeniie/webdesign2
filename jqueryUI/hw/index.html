   		 <p><h1>Animal Crossing: New Horizons Gameplay</h1>As in previous installments in the Animal Crossing series, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a nonlinear life simulation game played in real-time. The player assumes the role of a customizable character who moves to a deserted island after purchasing a deserted island package from Tom Nook, a tanuki character who is a staple of the series. The game proceeds in an open-ended fashion as the player explores the island, and develops it into a community of anthropomorphic animals. Players can collect different items to use as decorations within the game. Like in the 2017 spin-off title Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp for mobile devices, the game introduces a crafting system that allows the player to convert materials into tools and furniture, which can be used to decorate the game's interior and exterior spaces.</p>
   		 <p>The game allows the player to customize the appearance of their character at will, and does not lock specific hairstyles or facial features to specific genders. Players are additionally able to select their character's skin color, a feature introduced in the 2015 spin-off title Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer. Nook Miles, an in-game currency earned by completing various tasks, can be used to purchase premium items. Players are able to invite animals to live on their island, and have the option to choose or influence where the animal constructs their home. The game's weather adjusts to the seasons of the Northern or Southern Hemisphere, depending on the player's real-world location, a first for the Animal Crossing series. Another first is the addition of windy weather, which is expressed in the movement of the leaves on the trees.</p>
